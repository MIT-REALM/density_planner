            Autonomous systems with uncertainties are prevalent in robotics. However, ensuring 
            the safety of those systems is challenging due to sophisticated dynamics and the 
            hardness to predict future states. Usually, a classical motion planning method 
            considering all possible states will not find a feasible path in crowded 
            environments. To overcome this conservativeness, we propose a density-based method. 
            The proposed method uses a neural network and the Liouville equation to learn the 
            density evolution, and by applying a gradient-based optimization procedure, we can 
            plan for feasible and probably safe trajectories to minimize the collision risk. 
          </p>
          <p>
            We conduct experiments on simulated environments and environments generated from 
            real-world data and outperform baseline methods such as model predictive control (MPC) 
            and Non-linear programming (NLP). While our method requires planning time in advance, 
            the online computational complexity is very low when compared to other methods.

            This work solves the problem of defining an optimal control policy for a given autonomous system and environment setup.
            The system shall be steered to the goal state while minimizing the collision probability with possible dynamic obstacles. 
            Furthermore, the state and input constraints must be satisfied, and the system dynamics can be nonlinear in the states. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In contrast to standard motion planning problems, we consider an uncertain initial state following an arbitrary but known probability density function. 
            During the execution of the control policy, the state can be measured and used for closed-loop control. 
            However, because of limited computational power and the time constraints for real-time executability, the online computations of the controller have to be simple. 
            Furthermore, we consider imperfect measurements due to sensor bias.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, probabilistic predictions for the evolution of the environment are given. Namely, we know for each position in the environment the probability of it being occupied by an obstacle at a certain point in time.
            The position of the vehicle at this time depends on the initial state and hence also follows a certain probability distribution.
            The overlap of this state distribution with the predicted obstacle positions yields the collision probability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, the algorithm should find a general control strategy which minimizes the cost function and satisfies the constraints for the uncertain initial states despite sensor errors.
            The motion planning problem is visualized in the figure below.

            First, we design a tracking controller which will use real-time state measurements to track a reference trajectory. 
            To guarantee that the considered system stays in the neighborhood of the reference trajectory despite the initial state uncertainties and disturbances, we will use contraction theory for the controller synthesis. 
            The synthesis has to be done only once since the controller can be used for all reference trajectories and hence for all environment setups, as long as the dynamic system stays the same. 
          </p>
          <p>  
            By assuming the online execution of the tracking controller, the motion planning problem is simplified to finding the optimal reference trajectory for the closed-loop dynamics. 
            As we want to minimize the collision probability and have short computation times, we need an efficient way to compute the state density distribution along different reference trajectories. 
            On this account, we train a neural network which predicts the evolution of the state density distribution dependent on the reference trajectory and the initial state distribution. 
            With the neural density predictions, a differentiable collision risk can be computed efficiently. 
            Now, the reference trajectory can be optimized by minimizing the collision risk with a gradient-based algorithm.

            An example environment and the solution strategy is visualized in the figure below. For better visualizability, only stationary obstacles are considered.

            Our motion planning approach has several advantages over prior work: The approach is valid for arbitrary initial probability distributions and nonlinear system dynamics. 
            By predicting the probability distribution at each point in time, the approach is not over-cautious and can provide good estimates for the collision probabilities.
            Because of the neural network approximation of the closed-loop dynamics and the density function, and an efficient optimization framework, small planning times can be achieved. The resulting control strategy can be executed in real-time with low computational complexity.
            Additionally, the resulting trajectory is optimal in a given cost criteria and the gradient-based optimization method can easily overcome bad local minima by comparing the results of different start conditions.

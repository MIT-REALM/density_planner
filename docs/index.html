            Uncertainty is prevalent in robotics. Due to measurement noise and complex dynamics, 
            we cannot estimate the exact system and environment state. Since conservative motion 
            planners are not guaranteed to find a safe control strategy in a crowded, uncertain 
            environment, we propose a density-based method. Our approach uses a neural network 
            and the Liouville equation to learn the density evolution for a system with an 
            uncertain initial state. By applying a gradient-based optimization procedure, we can 
            plan for feasible and probably safe trajectories to minimize the collision risk. 
          </p>
          <p>
            We conduct motion planning experiments on simulated environments and environments 
            generated from real-world data and outperform baseline methods such as model 
            predictive control and nonlinear programming. While our method requires offline 
            planning, the online run time is 100times smaller compared to model predictive control.

            This work solves the problem of defining an optimal control policy for a given autonomous 
            system and environment setup. The system shall be steered to the goal state while 
            minimizing the collision probability with dynamic obstacles. Furthermore, the state and 
            input constraints must be satisfied, and the system dynamics can be nonlinear in the states. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In contrast to classical motion planning problems, we consider an uncertain initial state 
            following an arbitrary but known probability density function. During the execution of the 
            control policy, the state can be measured and used for closed-loop control. However, because 
            of limited computational power and the time constraints for real-time executability, the online 
            computations of the controller have to be simple. Furthermore, we consider imperfect 
            measurements due to sensor bias.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, probabilistic predictions for the evolution of the environment are given. Namely, 
            we know for each position in the environment the probability of it being occupied by an obstacle 
            at a certain point in time. The position of the vehicle at this time depends on the initial state 
            and hence also follows a certain probability distribution. The overlap of this state distribution 
            with the predicted obstacle positions yields the collision probability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, the algorithm should find a general control strategy which minimizes the cost function and 
            satisfies the constraints for the uncertain initial states despite sensor errors. The motion 
            planning problems are visualized in the figures below.

            First, we design a tracking controller which uses real-time state measurements to track a reference 
            trajectory. To guarantee that the considered system stays in the neighborhood of the reference 
            trajectory despite the initial state uncertainties and disturbances, we will use contraction theory 
            for the controller synthesis. The synthesis has to be done only once since the controller can be 
            used for all reference trajectories and hence for all environment setups, as long as the system 
            dynamics stay the same. 
          </p>
          <p>  
            After defining the tracking controller, the motion planning problem is simplified to finding the optimal 
            reference trajectory for the closed-loop dynamics. As we want to minimize the collision probability 
            and have short computation times, we need an efficient way to compute the state density distribution 
            along different reference trajectories. On this account, we train a neural network which predicts the 
            evolution of the state density distribution dependent on the reference trajectory and the initial 
            state distribution. With the neural density predictions, a differentiable collision risk can be 
            computed efficiently. Now, the reference trajectory can be optimized by minimizing the collision risk 
            with a gradient-based algorithm.

            An example environment and the solution strategy is visualized in the figures below. For better 
            visualizability, only stationary obstacles are considered.

            Our motion planning approach has several advantages over prior work: The approach is valid for 
            arbitrary initial probability distributions and nonlinear system dynamics. By predicting the 
            probability distribution at each point in time, the approach is not over-cautious and can 
            provide good estimates for the collision probabilities. Because of the neural network 
            approximation of the closed-loop dynamics and the density function, and an efficient optimization 
            framework, small planning times can be achieved. The resulting control strategy can be executed 
            in real-time with low computational complexity. Additionally, the resulting trajectory is optimal 
            in a given cost criteria and the gradient-based optimization method can easily overcome bad local 
            minima by comparing the results of different start conditions.
